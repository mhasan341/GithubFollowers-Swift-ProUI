## About
Github Geeks is a simple yet powerful application to demonstrate the power of Swift Programming Language in iOS app development. This app was made as a part of my portfolio.

## Video Mockup
A full video can be found here: [Github Geeks - Youtube](https://youtu.be/n3_B59ncsSA)

## Features
This app will be updated later if time permits. Currently it built using the following capabilities

- ProgrammaticUI 
- No Third Party Library
- Network Manager built from ground with support for image caching
- Pagination of CollectionView
- Custom ViewControllers and their usage
- Reusing views
- Swift Standard Practices

There isn't much comment at all, because the code explains itself.
